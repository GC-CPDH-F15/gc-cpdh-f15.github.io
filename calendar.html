            <h3>Course Calendar</h3>

            <p>As the curtain rises on this course, several class meetings remain unstructured. This (hopefully) will allow us to take advantage of a few different kinds of opportunities: topics identified during our discussion, guest speakers, and topics that simply need more time for discussion.</p>

            <p>Here's a gcal view of the course, in case it's helpful:</p>

                            <p>Welcome to class.... Today we'll introduce ourselves
                                and and talk about where this class should take us.
                                Be prepared to talk a bit about the research questions
                                you're asking these days, and how they might relate
                                to this class. (Research questions like, "What should
                                I be researching?" are perfectly admissible.)</p>
                            <p>Also, we'll talk about situating ourselves and this class
                                in the context of C.P. Snow's famous "two cultures"
                                lecture. To that end, please read the essay version
                                of his lecture (the link provides both HTML and PDF
                                versions), and reflect on how well the "two cultures"
                                reflects--or doesn't--your scholarly background and
                                aspirations. How are Snow's beliefs and concerns
                                relevant to the contemporary practices of the digital
                                humanities? How are they related to Taylor's slightly
                                more recent perspective?

	<p>Images and their analysis are also the subject of DH inquiry, though this is perhaps a newer flavor of inquiry than text-based inquiry is. The first two papers (and the supporting survey data) describe an interesting proto-collaboration between computer scientists and art historians. Saleh et al describe a computational approach to making claims of influence between artists, based on computational analysis of images of paintings and machine learning applied to features derived from that analysis. Responding to that paper and its popular reception, Spratt and Elgammal reflect on the significance and possibility of deeper collaboration between art historians and computer scientists</p>
	
		<p>Chung et al and Toler-Franklin et al are fairly technical treatments of how computer vision techniques have been applied to two humanistic problems. Chung et al analyze and classify woodblock prints from a large corpus of <a href="http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/about">ballads held at the Bodleian Library</a>; Toler-Franklin et al apply computer vision and machine learning techniques to help re-assemble shattered classical frescoes. </p>

                            <p>As the histories we read a couple weeks ago suggest,
                                text is a central focus of many digital humanists.
                                One major problem is the digital encoding of texts
                                (which can be exceptionally complicated things) in
                                a way that best supports their study and dissemination.
                                This week, we'll focus on the biggest player in humanities
                                text encoding: the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org">Text Encoding Initiative</a>                                (TEI). Much technical and political effort has gone
                                into producing a text encoding standard for the humanities
                                that seems likely to stand the test of time; "TEI:
                                History" gives a brief history of the development
                                of the TEI, while Renear gives a longer (and somewhat
                                out of date, ending c. 2004) history of the problem
                                of text encoding.</p>

                            <p>Text encoding mainly from concerns about the dissemination
                                and preservation of text, but it also can be used
                                to support analyses that would be extraordinarily
                                difficult to perform on "plain" text. "Text Analysis
                                and the TEI" is an exercise in analyzing heavily-encoded
                                text (in this case,
                                <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>); do the exercise and spend
                                some time playing with the possibilities. Duhaime
                                writes of a larger exploration of the corpus of Shakespeare's
                                plays. What kinds of questions/problems could you
                                imagine exploring with this sort of encoded text?</p>

                            <p>Musicology is embracing digital methods, too; in many
                                ways, the digital representation, manipulation, and
                                analysis of music offers even greater challenges
                                than similar work with text. Papdopoulos gives a (slightly out-of-date) survey of techniques for <em>algorithmically generating</em> musical works. Pugin offers a perspective
                                on current problems in digital musicology. The Music
                                Encoding Initiative provides a history and introduction
                                to some of the challenges of encoding music in rough
                                analogy with the Text Encoding Initiative's work.
                                Pugin et al (Verovio) and meiView illustrate some
                                applications of the MEI. Randolph introduces a completely
                                different sort of computational music challenge.</p>

                            <p>One of the digital humanities' general imperatives is
                                improving our access both to archival materials (eg
                                by digitizing texts and publishing them online) and
                                to scholar materials (eg by publishing in "open access"
                                fora, or by using and producing "open source" code).
                                Spiro argues this impulse is, in part, a defining
                                    one for DH.</p><p> But are these forms of openness enough? 
                                Making sure people of all abilities have access to
                                digital resources is a computational problem that
                                goes well beyond the digital humanities but certainly
                                affects them. How does "data visualization," for
                                example, work for people whose vision is outside
                                'normal' parameters? Could data visualizations be
                                translated into <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/data-visceralization/370899/">data visceralizations</a>?
                                Williams suggests that DH projects should hew to
                                principles of "universal design," and reports on
                                one project aiming to "make the digital humanities
                                more open." Heron offers an example of how to think
                                through accessibility in the context of a reasonably
                                complex text-based application game.</p>
