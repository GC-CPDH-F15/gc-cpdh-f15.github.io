    <h2>Discussion and Attendance</h2>
    
<p>Twenty percent of your grade will be based on your general,
everyday, ongoing participation in classroom discussion. Obviously,
discussion is predicated on attendance, so I expect you to
be in class (see my attendance policy on the main course page).</p>

<p>You will be best prepared to make valuable contributions to the
discussion if you've carefully read the assigned reading and have
developed a few questions provoked by it.</p>
