            <h3>Bulletin Description</h3>
            <p class="quotation">
                A new "science" emerges where a new problem is pursued by a new method....[L]iterature
                is not an object, it's a problem, and a problem that asks for a new
                critical method: and no one has ever found a method by just reading
                more texts. That's not how theories come into being; they need a
                leap, a wager&mdash;a hypothesis, to get started. (Moretti, <em>Distant Reading</em>)
            </p>

            <p>In this course, we will consider literature and other problems of the
                humanist sciences. We will collectively wager on the potential energy
                of diverse scholarly preparations brought into close proximity. Perhaps,
                we will bring into being new theories and new methods, both computational
                and humanist.</p>
            <p>For this course, our most valuable assets will be not what we know, but
                how well we can say, "I don't understand." Our task will be not to
                perform our knowledge for others who share it but to communicate
                it effectively across "disciplinary" boundaries. Ideally, this course
                will address problems in both computing and the humanist sciences,
                and, through those problems, uncover both new techniques and new
                problems in both domains.</p>

            <h3>Prerequisites and Corequisites</h3>
            <p>This course is open to all students with scholarly affinities anywhere
                along the following spectrum</p>
            <p>
                (on one end, the) Humanist:
                <br/> You are a scholar of the humanities
                <br/> with an interest in using computational methods
                <br/> to support your research. You seek novel arguments,
                <br/> novel processes, and novel collaborations.
            </p>

            <p>
                (and on the other, the) Technologist:
                <br/> You are a scholar of computation
                <br/> with an interest in applying computational methods
                <br/> to novel problems. You seek novel problem domains,
                <br/> novel solutions, and novel collaborations.
            </p>


            <h3>Course Objectives</h3> Upon completion of this course, you will have gained experience:

            <ul>
                <li>engaging in scholarly discourse with scholars and texts outside your
                    discipline/specialization
                </li>
                <li>formulating and carrying out a collaborative multi-disciplinary research
                    project
                </li>
            </ul>
            This experience will come from three primary activities:
            <ol>
                <li>Reading and discussion of both humanities/social science and computing
                    texts, with an emphasis on trans-disciplinary conversation.
                </li>
                <li>Presenting on topic of interest, including the selection of relevant readings and/or case studies.</li>
                <li>Collaborative research project with a publishable outcome.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You will also keep a reading/research journal in which you will record
                your impressions of, responses to, and questions provoked by the
                readings, as well as reflections on the research component of the
                course.
            </p>


            <h3>Grading</h3>
            <p>Your work in this class will contribute to your final grade as follows
                (subject to change, with plenty of notice):</p>

            <p>
                25% <a href="journal.html">Journal</a>
                <br/> 25%
                <a href="minisession.html">Mini-session</a></br>
                50%
                <a href="project.html">Course Project</a>
            </p>


            <h3>Values, Policies and Resources</h3>

            <h4>Collaboration</h4>
            <p>Both computer science and digital humanities, as modes of inquiry, value
                and often require collaboration. This class is no exception. In particular,
                the real world often demands collaboration across disciplinary lines,
                so, as far as the demographics of the class permit, I expect you
                to seek collaborators outside your "home discipline."</p>

            <h4>Academic Honesty</h4>


            <p>
                I take academic honesty very seriously. Completing your own work is the foundation
                of the educational process and of professionalism, both yours and
                mine. You are responsible for understanding the
                <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/la/Academic_Integrity_Policy.pdf">CUNY</a>                and
                <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/Publications/Student_Handbook_web.pdf">Graduate Center</a>                policies pertaining to academic integrity, including both intentional
                and unintentional plagiarism. Lapses of academic integrity (e.g.,
                plagiarism of books, articles, or papers written by others; unauthorized
                “recycling” of work completed for another course; etc.) will result
                in severe consequences, at minimum a failing grade (F) for the assignment.</p>


            <h4>Attendance and Deadlines</h4>

            <p>The success of this class depends much more on your presence and participation
                than it does on mine! You'll certainly have plenty to work on outside
                of class, but I expect you to attend all class meetings, on time.
                So, this is a statement of values, not a threat: If you are late
                or absent more than once (one class), your final grade will drop
                one full letter for each late arrival or absence thereafter.</p>

            <p>Similarly, I want you to complete the class work by the end of the semester&mdash;especially
                because so much of the work is collaborative. So, I expect you to
                meet the few deadlines/milestones described elsewhere in this syllabus.
                Late work will be docked 20% (e.g., an A assignment will receive
                a C). I do not accept work seven days beyond the deadline; in such
                cases a zero is recorded for the assignment. There are no exceptions
                to this policy, especially in cases of printer, email, or other computer
                problems.
            </p>

            <p>I will not assign an Incomplete final grade.</p>


            <h4>Communication</h4>

            <p>
                But: I want this to be a rewarding and successful semester for you. If, for whatever
                reason, you have difficulty maintaining the reading schedule, meeting
                deadlines, or have other course-related issues, please contact me
                immediately. It's in your best interest to keep me informed of your
                progress, good or bad. Make an appointment with me so that we can
                discuss it.
            </p>


            <h4>Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility</h4>
            <p> I believe the classroom is hugely enriched by the presence of individual
                diversity of all kinds. I am deeply committed to creating an inclusive
                classroom that respects a wide range of experiences, viewpoints,
                and abilities. I encourage students who have a disability (or suspect
                they may have one) to contact Sharon Lerner or Elise Perram (212-817-7400
                or disabilityservices@gc.cuny.edu) and consult the Graduate Center
                Student Handbook. If you have a documented disability that needs
                accommodation, please schedule a time to meet with me so that we
                can discuss it privately.</p>

            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>I don't expect this to be an issue for this class, but I expect you to
                have an email account that you check regularly, as well as access
                to whatever course management technology (Blackboard, Academic Commons,
                etc) we use for the course.</p>
