		<h3>Bulletin Description</h3>
		<p class="quotation">
			A new "science" emerges where a new problem is pursued by a new
			method....[L]iterature is not an object, it’s a problem, and a
			problem that asks for a new critical method: and no one has ever
			found a method by just reading more texts. That’s not how theories
			come into being; they need a leap, a wager&mdash;a hypothesis, to get
			started. (Moretti, <em>Distant Reading</em>)
		</p>

		<p>In this course, we will consider literature and other problems
			of the humanist sciences. We will collectively wager on the potential
			energy of diverse scholarly preparations brought into close
			proximity. Perhaps, we will bring into being new theories and new
			methods, both computational and humanist.</p>
		<p>For this course, our most valuable assets will be not what we
			know, but how well we can say, “I don't understand.” Our task will be
			not to perform our knowledge for others who share it but to
			communicate it effectively across “disciplinary” boundaries. Ideally,
			this course will address problems in both computing and the humanist
			sciences, and, through those problems, uncover both new techniques
			and new problems in both domains.</p>

		<h3>Prerequisites and Corequisites</h3>
		This course is open to all students with scholarly affinities anywhere
		along the following spectrum
		<p>
			(on one end, the) Humanist:</br> You are a scholar of the humanities</br> with
			an interest in using computational methods</br> to support your research.
			You seek novel arguments,</br> novel processes, and novel collaborations.
		</p>

		<p>
			(and on the other, the) Technologist:</br> You are a scholar of
			computation </br> with an interest in applying computational methods</br> to
			novel problems. You seek novel problem domains,</br> novel solutions, and
			novel collaborations.
		</p>


		<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
		Upon completion of this course, students will have gained experience:

		<ul>
			<li>engaging in scholarly discourse with scholars and texts
				outside their discipline/specialization</li>
			<li>formulating and carrying out a collaborative
				multi-disciplinary research project</li>
		</ul>
		This experience will come from three primary activities:
		<ol>
			<li>Reading and discussion of both humanities/social science and
				computing texts, with an emphasis on trans-disciplinary
				conversation.</li>
			<li>Presenting on (or, hopefully, teaching) a reading.</li>
			<li>Collaborative research project.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Students will also keep a reading/research journal in which
			they will record their impressions of, responses to, and questions
			provoked by the readings, as well as reflections on the research
			component of the course.</p>


		<h3>Grading Policy</h3>
		<p>Your work in this class will contribute to your final grade as
			follows (subject to change, with plenty of notice):</p>

		<p>
			20% Discussion Participation</br> 20% Journal</br> 20% Mini-presentation</br> 40%
			Course Project</br>

		</p>


		<h3>College Policies and Resources</h3>

		<h4>Academic Honesty</h4>

		<p>
			I take academic honesty very seriously. Here's the relevant language
			from the <a
				href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/Publications/Student_Handbook_web.pdf">GC
				student handbook</a>: Each member of the academic community is expected
			to give full, fair, and formal credit to any and all sources that
			have contributed to the formulation of ideas, methods,
			interpretations, and findings. The absence of such formal credit is
			an affirmation representing that the work is fully the writer's. The
			term "sources" includes, but is not limited to, published or
			unpublished materials, lectures and lecture notes, computer programs,
			mathematical and other symbolic formulations, course papers,
			examinations, theses, dissertations, and comments offered in class or
			informal discussions, and includes electronic media. The
			representation that such work of another person is the writer’s own
			is plagiarism. Care must be taken to document the source of any ideas
			or arguments. If the actual words of a source are used, they must
			appear within quotation marks. In cases that are unclear, it is the
			responsibility of the writer to take due care to avoid plagiarism.
			The source should be cited whenever:
			<ul>
				<li>a text is quoted verbatim
					<li>data gathered by another are presented in diagrams or
						tables
						<li>the results of a study done by another are used
							<li>the work or intellectual effort of another is
								paraphrased by the writer
			</ul>
			Because the intent to deceive is not a necessary element in
			plagiarism, careful notetaking and record keeping are essential in
			order to avoid unintentional plagiarism.
		</p>

		<h4>Accommodation and Access</h4>
		If you need any kind of assistance accessing course materials or
		carrying out course activities, please let me know. I'll be more than
		happy to provide accommodations, either formally through Student
		Affairs or informally.
