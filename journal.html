    <h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Twenty-five percent of your grade will depend on your ongoing
  maintenance of a reading/research journal for the class. How you
  implement the journal is up to you: it can certainly be on a public
  or private blog (as long as I am able to read it!), or it can
  take the form of email messages to me. This can (should!) be very
  informal, low-stakes writing: initial reactions to readings, musings
  about the class project, questions and puzzlements. If you share
  your journal only with me, I will maintain your confidentiality,
	though I may ask you in class to discuss ideas from your journal.</p>

<p>I will aim to give you a few writing prompts each week (some weeks in the calendar already include prompts). In general, I'd like you to
	<ol><li>reflect on the readings: provocative? illumating? boring? did you read any of the cited work? is this something you want to learn more about? what questions are left unanswered?</li>
	<li>reflect on how the readings illustrate a relationship between computationan and the humanities;</li>
	<li>identify areas you'd like to discuss in class--things you find confusing, or things you have strong opinions about, perhaps;</li> <li>develop your thinking around your class-work--brainstorm topics for your mini-session, work through some research questions, whatever.</li></ol> </p>

<p>This element of the course is intended to</p>
	<ol><li>help you formulate your ideas about the readings before you come to class,</li>
	<li>help me get a sense, before we meet, of how the readings were received and</li>
	<li>help both of us make sure your project work is on track.</li></ol>

	<p>Therefore, I expect you to share a journal entry at
  least weekly, at the latest by Wednesday evening.</p>
