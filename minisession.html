    <h2>Mini-session</h2>
<p>Twenty-five percent of your course grade depends on your leading a mini-session (roughly 30 minutes) of class dedicated to a topic of your choosing. The focus of the session should be a particular computational problem and how it relates to the digital humanities (does it arise from DH? has/will its solution help DH?) You should identify one or two readings and a "case study" tool or project, which you will share with the class at least a week before your session. We will collectively decide how these session should be structured.</p>

<p>This element of the course is intended to give you the opportunity to become (more) expert in an area of interest to you&mdash;I expect that identifying a few interesting artifacts will require you to look at a couple dozen, at least, and there's nothing like teaching to solidify your understanding of a subject.</p>

<p>You should have a topic identified (to share with the class) by <strong>September 24</strong> (our 4th meeting). This can be a topic related to one of the already-scheduled classes&mdash;maybe you want to look at an angle of computational musicology&mdash;or it can be another interest you have or would like to develop.</p>
