            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>Fifty percent of your course grade depends on this project. The main
                features of this project are that it is <em>collaborative</em>, <em>publishable</em>,
                and (of course) addresses a <em>computational problem in the digital humanities</em>.</p>

            <p><em>Collaborative</em>. You will work in groups of 2 or 3, which we'll
                determine through a combination of research interests and experience.
                I will not give you any particular structure for your group, but
                you will need to determine your own structure early on (see <a href="#milestones">Milestones</a>                below). </p>


            <p><em>Publishable</em>. Your work should be presentable in an appropriate
                national/international conference (ideally, but not necessarily,
                one with a published proceedings). Your grade will not be affected
                by whether or not you are actually published, but your work should
                be guided and justified by this goal. See
                <a href="#milestones">Milestones</a> and <a href="#Venues">Venues</a>.
            </p>

            <p><em>Computational problem</em>. Your project should be organized a computational
                problem relevant to the digital humanities: one we discuss in class,
                one you bring to class, or one you discover along the way. Of course,
                you may only be able to take on a very small piece of a problem;
                that's absolutely fine. The nature of your "deliverable" should be
                determined by the nature of the problem and your own creativity (though
                you will need also to deliver an in-class presentation as well as
                a draft conference paper).</p>

            <h3><a name="milestones">Milestones</a></h3>

            <p>We'll talk more about these milestones as class gets under way, but this
                outline should give you enough to start thinking.</p>

            <p><em>Group Formation and Topic Selection</em>. We will finalize group
                composition at our second meeting (September 3). By <strong>September 17</strong>                (our 3rd meeting), you should have identified, at least, the general
                topic of your project. Submit to me a brief topic statement and a
                brief description of each member's particular role in the group.</p>

            <p><em>Problem Identification, Venue Candidates</em>. By <strong>October 1</strong>                (our 5th meeting), you should have narrowed your topic to a specific
                problem (or piece of a problem), and you should have identified one
                or more appropriate publication/presentation venues for your work.
                Submit to me one paragraph "abstract" of the problem and your approach
                to it, a list of at least 3 relevant citations, and a brief statement(s)
                about the appropriateness of your chosen venue(s) for the project.</p>

            <p><em>Presentation and Paper (and Product)</em>. Finally, by the end of
                class, you will deliver a conference-grade presentation on your work
                to the class, and you will draft a conference-suitable paper. If
                appropriate, you will also make publicly available any tools/code
                you created for the project. I expect we'll have 3 or 4 groups, so we should be able to have all the presentations during the time allotted for our final exam on <strong>Dec 17</strong>. Your paper will be due at that time.</p>

            <p>You are more than welcome to get things done early :) -- and I'm more
                than happy to discuss drafts, ideas, and so on, in advance of the
                due dates.</p>


            <h3><a name="#Venues">Venues</a></h3> To find an appropriate venue (or even to start your thinking about what
            kinds of problems might be of interest to you), you should seek out relevant
            conferences and symposia. Some places to look, of all kinds:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/category/news/cfp/">Digital Humanities Now CFPs</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/conferences.cfm">The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)'s list of upcoming and recent conferences</a>.</li>
                <li>Big DH conferences, like <a href="http://dh2015.org/cfp/">DH (2015)</a></li>
		<li>Specialist conferences, like the annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/?page_id=71">Association for Documentary Editing</a></li>
                <li>Technology-focused conferences, like <a href="https://textencodinginitiative.wordpress.com/2015/03/30/call-for-papers-tei-members-meeting-and-conference-2015/">TEI 2015</a>                    or the <a href="http://music-encoding.org/community/conference/call-for-proposals/">Music Encoding Conference.</a></li></ul>

            (But don't feel limited by these! Our readings, and the sources they cite, may give you some additional ideas.)
